## Introduction

Hi dear ***Python*** programmers. As you can see here, you have a simple folder structure to write and test basic Python scripts, helping you enhance your knowledge, skills, and experience.

## A Quick Look at the Folder Structure

This project follows a structured layout to keep everything organized and maintainable. The `src` directory contains the main source code, while `public` is for static assets. Configuration files such as `.env` and `.gitignore` help with environment management and version control. Additionally, `setup.sh` automates the initial setup process, and `requirements.txt` lists necessary dependencies. By following this structure, the project remains easy to navigate and scalable for future development.

## Setup

To get started with the project, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theahmadrezza/PyHub.git
cd PyHub
chmod +x script.sh
source script.sh
```

These commands ensure that you clone the repository, navigate into it, make script.sh executable, and run it correctly in your shell environment.

## Keep Learning, Keep Coding! ðŸš€

Programming is not just about writing code; itâ€™s about solving problems, thinking logically, and continuously improving. Here are some simple yet powerful Python snippets to remind you of the beauty of coding:

### Print Your First Python Message  

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

### Find the Power of Python in One Line

```python
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11)]
print(squared_numbers)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, ..., 100]
```

## Final Words

This structured approach ensures that your Python projects remain well-organized and easy to manage. Feel free to extend and modify this setup based on your needs. Happy coding, and may your journey with Python be as smooth and enjoyable as possible!
